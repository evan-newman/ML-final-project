\maketitle
\section{Data preprocessing}
Did you pre-process your data in any way? This can be for the purpose of reducing dimension, or reducing noise, or balancing the class distribution. Be clear about what you exactly did. The criterion is to allow others to precisely replicate your works.

\section{Learning algorithms}
\subsection{Algorithms/methods explored}
Provide a list of learning algorithms that you explored for this project. For each algorithm, briefly justify your rationale for choosing this algorithm.
\subsection{Final models}
What are the final models that produced your submitted test predictions? Be sure to provide enough detail so that by reading the description, the model can be recreated.

\section{Parameter Tuning and Model Selection }
\subsection{Parameter Tuning}
What parameters did you tune for your models? How do you perform the parameter tuning?

\subsection{Model selection}
How did you decide which models to use to produce the final predictions?  Do you use cross-validation or hold-out for model selection? When you split the data for validation, is it fully random or special consideration went into forming the folds? What criterion is used to select the models?

\section{Results}
Do you have any internal evaluation results you want to report?
